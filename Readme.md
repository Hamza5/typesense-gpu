## Introduction

This repository provides a Docker setup for running Typesense with GPU support. It leverages the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to utilize the GPU for Typesense operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- NVIDIA Drivers (compatible with your CUDA version)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x4139/typesense-gpu.git
cd typesense-gpu
```

## Running the Service

To start the Typesense service, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will build and run the Typesense container with GPU support.

## GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to manually build and push the Docker image.

To trigger the workflow manually:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Select the "Build and Push Docker Image" workflow.
3. Click "Run workflow".
4. Enter the desired `Typesense Version` and `CUDA Version` (or use the defaults).
5. Click "Run workflow".

## Modifying Versions

You can specify different versions of Typesense and CUDA by modifying the `.env` file in the repository. Create a `.env` file in the root directory if it doesn't exist and add the following content:

```
TYPESENSE_VERSION=your_typesense_version
CUDA_VERSION=your_cuda_version
API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Replace `your_typesense_version`, `your_cuda_version`, and `your_api_key` with the desired versions and API key.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in the `.env` file:

- `TYPESENSE_VERSION`: The version of Typesense to use.
- `CUDA_VERSION`: The version of CUDA to use.
- `API_KEY`: The API key for Typesense.

## GPU Requirements

Ensure you have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed and configured. Follow the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) to set up the toolkit.

Additionally, make sure your system has the appropriate NVIDIA drivers installed that are compatible with your desired CUDA version.
